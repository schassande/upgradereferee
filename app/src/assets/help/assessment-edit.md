* You have to define the competition. Either you select an existing competition either you simply set a competition name.
* When you are creating a new assessment you define the type of assessment: **Referee** means you assess a referee, **Referee Coach* means you assess a referee coach. This type cannot be changed once the assessment has been created/saved.
* You define the date, the time slot and the field of the game.
* For the assessment of a referee, you define the game information : skill of the teams, speed of the game and the teams category
