# Positive point

To add a positive point to the selected referee, click on the **+ green** button (bottom right).
A new page is shown. On this page you can write:

- a **short description** of the positive point
- a **full description** of the positive point
- you can set the **period** number of the observed point
- The **deliver** field indicates if you decided to deliver this point to the referee during a coaching session.

To register the positive point, simply click on the back arrow on top left corner. If the short description is empty, no feedback is added to the coaching.
When you come back on the coaching page, the new positive point is listed in the corresponding section. In this section, on each lind of positive point, you have two icons:

- the **!** icon represents the **deliver**'** field. Click on it to change the status
- The **trash** icon at the end permit to delete the item.
